# Customizable-Health-Chatbot-using-ChatGPT
This project focuses on developing a customizable health chatbot using ChatGPT, an advanced language model powered by OpenAI.
The chatbot allows users to interactively seek health-related information, advice, and support in a conversational manner.

# Functionality
The chatbot leverages the capabilities of ChatGPT to provide personalized responses to user queries. Users can input their health-related questions or concerns, and the chatbot will generate informative and relevant responses.

The project consists of the following code files:
*main.py: This file contains the code for the customizable health chatbot using ChatGPT.
*other_files.py: Additional code files with simpler functionalities related to the project (not linked to the web interface).

# Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including openai, gradio, and other relevant libraries.
You can install the dependencies by running pip install -r requirements.txt.

3. Set up your OpenAI API key by replacing "####" in the openai.api_key line in main.py with your actual API key.
This step is crucial for successful integration with ChatGPT.

4. Run the main.py file to start the customizable health chatbot.

5. Access the chatbot by launching the web interface provided by Gradio. It allows users
to input their health-related questions or concerns and receive informative responses from the chatbot.

6. Additionally, you can explore the other code files (other_files.py) to understand and experiment with simpler functionalities related to the project

# Important Note
This project is for educational and demonstration purposes, showcasing the capabilities of ChatGPT in the context of a customizable health chatbot. It is recommended to further enhance and refine the chatbot by incorporating additional features, optimizing response generation, and ensuring accuracy and reliability of the health-related information provided.

*Note: Ensure that you use the OpenAI API responsibly and adhere to the terms and conditions outlined by OpenAI.

Feel free to modify, customize, and expand upon the project code to suit your specific requirements and explore new possibilities in the domain of customizable health chatbots.

Please refer to the documentation and relevant resources for further guidance on using the OpenAI API and Gradio for chatbot development.
